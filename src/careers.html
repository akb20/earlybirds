          <span class="has-text-weight-bold">At Earlybirds we aim to make the experience of new teachers joining us as comfortable as possible.</span> This
          begins during the recruitment process itself, we as an organization want teachers who agree with our ethos in relation
          to teaching during the interview stage we are very clear on how we as an organization and the teachers can work
          together to achieve it. We also want teachers to take ownership of the teaching experience and bring their own
          experience and creativity into the classroom. We feel this approach gives new teachers confidence as they feel
          they have a major part to play in our success in delivering a top quality learning experience. As an Organization
          we offer:</p>
        <ul class="spaced">
          <li>
            <span class="check" data-jam="check" data-fill="#222"></span> Full support during the recruitment process.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="check" data-jam="check" data-fill="#222"></span> Dedicated visa support staff.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="check" data-jam="check" data-fill="#222"></span> Help in getting accommodation and setting up bank account and with all other issues when establishing
            yourself in a new country.

          <li>

        </ul>

        <p class="spaced">
          <span class="has-text-weight-bold">We as an organization have a very teacher focused management philosophy.</span> We believe that the main role of
          management is to support the teachers to do that we follow an number of different strategies: the first is that
          the management structure is very clear, so we have the director of studies who is supported by a number of Senior
          teachers. This we feel allows teachers to have a point of contact and support at all times and across all campuses.
          Allied to this at the beginning of each academic year we institute a buddy system which pairs new teachers with
          long term members of staff allowing them to observe best practice in the classroom and allowing the teachers to
          grow in their job while feeling they always have support when they need it. In relation to management we offer:</p>

        <ul class="spaced">
          <li>
            <span class="check" data-jam="check" data-fill="#222"></span> A flat hierarchy in management , which we feel generates an environment that is conducive the exchange
            of ideas of best practice in relation to teaching that is not predicated on peoples role within the organization.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="check" data-jam="check" data-fill="#222"></span> A clear demarcation of responsibilities that allows teachers to feel confident at all times within the
            teaching environment.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="check" data-jam="check" data-fill="#222"></span> A buddy system, which allows the free exchange of knowledge in a informal way that leads to the building
            of strong relationships within the team.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="check" data-jam="check" data-fill="#222"></span> Clear disciplinary procedures that are not deviated from giving teachers clarity at all times.
          </li>

        </ul>
